title: "What's Now in Rails Libraries"
---

<p>In its estimable wisdom, Google thinks I have something to say about Rails libraries.  You probably arrived here because of that fact. Gems, plugins, engines, or other, if it has to do with Rails, I'm interested!</p>

<p>The Rails landscape is changing all the time, but I hope to provide you with some good information here.  If you find it useful, or if you have questions or want me to cover something else, won't you contact me on Twitter via @bigfleet?</p>

<p><a href="http://someguysblog.com/2008/11/24/what-s-now-in-rails-libraries/">My original blog post</a> has some information about my favorites.  I'll need to update that, since I've found some more good ones, and fixturereplacement now has a third version.</p>

<p>Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9 are going to have a big effect in the coming year on <strong>What's Now</strong>.  In particular, I think you should visit <a href="http://magicscalingsprinkles.wordpress.com/2010/01/28/why-i-wrote-arel/">Nick Kallen's write-up on arel</a></p>

<p>Megan is serving breakfast, so that's all for now!</p>
