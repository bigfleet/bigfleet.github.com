Iâ€™m happy that you dropped by.

<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

<p>I am a software developer.  I did HTML and PHP in high school, then learned Java in college.  After being uninspired by what was then the state of the art in Java programming on the web, I left for Ruby and haven't looked back yet.</p>

<p>At this writing in the June of 2012, I am 33 years old.  I grew up in East Tennessee, attending Maryville High School. I went to school at Rice where I help with recruiting. After graduating, I moved to the Richmond, VA area where I met my lovely wife, <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/">Megan</a>.  We were married on August 18, 2007. We moved to Charlotte, NC, where we share a <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-pictures-and-week-in-review.html">lovely home</a>  just outside I-277, minutes from Uptown.  On April 19 of 2011, she gave birth naturally to our son <a href="http://blog.meganvanfleet.com/2012/05/thinking.html">Jefferson James Van Fleet</a>.</p>

<p>After a year of freelancing, I accepted a position CTO of a company called <a href="http://otherscreen.com">OtherScreen</a> In February of 2011.  OtherScreen is a social TV startup providing companion content to live television or radio broadcasts.  We are building this company with the plan to sell it, and I'm very excited at the possibilities.</p>
  
<p>My primary hobbies are basically indistinguishable from my work.  In addition to copious computer geekery, I also play disc golf and video games.  I am at the very beginning of learning to play the guitar, and I still hope to write the Great American Novel of the next generation.</p>

<p>I unashamedly stole this design and typography from <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.  Credit for my avatar goes to my brother-in-law, Ryan Epp, and Megan, who asked him to do it.</p>

I think it's more likely you'd want to subscribe to <a href="http://bitly.com/bigfleet-newsletter">my newsletter about the Charlotte Startup Community</a> or perhaps <a href="http://twitter.com/bigfleet">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>I also have walkthroughs for a couple of brain-teasers, the <a href="/smarty/srat.html">Self-Referential Aptitude Test</a> and <a href="/smarty/who-owns-the-fish.html">Who Owns the Fish?</a></p>
