Iâ€™m happy that you dropped by.

<h2>A Bit About Me</h2>

<p>I am a software developer.  I did HTML and PHP in high school, then learned Java in college.  After being uninspired by what was then the state of the art in Java programming on the web, I left for Ruby and haven't looked back yet.</p>

<p>I'll begin my 4th decade on Earth in February of '09.  I grew up in East Tennessee, attending Maryville High School. I went to school at Rice where I help with recruiting. After graduating, I moved to the Richmond, VA area where I met my lovely wife, <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/">Megan</a>.  We were married on August 18, 2007. We moved to Charlotte, NC, where we share a <a href="http://meganvanfleet.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-pictures-and-week-in-review.html">lovely home</a>  just outside I-277, minutes from Uptown.</p>
  
<p>My primary hobbies are basically indistinguishable from my work.  In addition to copious computer geekery, I also play disc golf, tennis, and video games.  I am at the very beginning of learning to play the guitar, and I still hope to write the Great American Novel of the next generation.</p>

<p>I unashamedly stole this design and typography from <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.  Credit for my avatar goes to my brother-in-law, Ryan Epp, and Megan, who asked him to do it.</p>

<h2>What Now?</h2>

<p>In addition to checking out <a href="http://www.someguysblog.com/">my blog</a>, you might want to check out <a href="http://github.com/bigfleet">my open-source software contributions</a>, or my presence in the <a href="http://bigfleet.mp/">Internet at-large</a>.</p>

<p>I also have walkthroughs for a couple of brain-teasers, the <a href="/smarty/srat.html">Self-Referential Aptitude Test</a> and <a href="/smarty/who-owns-the-fish.html">Who Owns the Fish?</a></p>
