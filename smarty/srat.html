title: Self-Referential Aptitude Test
---

<p>Along the same lines as the <a href="./who-owns-the-fish.html">fish puzzle</a>, I got a pointer to the <a href="http://www.drunkmenworkhere.org/170">self-referential aptitude test</a> some time ago.  I don't know what it says about me that I am the sort of person that not only likes to solve these puzzles, but also walk through their solutions with strangers.  I am not going to think about it too hard.</p>

<p>First, the instructions are massively useful in completing this test.  Keep this in mind as we progress.</p>

<p>Second, this is just one possible walkthrough, and it's the second time I have gone through the test.  It was <strong>much</strong> harder the first time.</p>

<h3>Easy Ones:</h3>

<p>It's my sincerest wish that identity will hold in this exam;  the answer to #5 is <em>E</em>.</p>

<p>#20 gets special attention in the instructions, and by consulting reference material, we establish that answer is <em>E</em></p>

<h3>Warming Up:</h3>

<p>Questions #10 and #16 refer to each other.  The only correct set of answers possible means #10 is <em>A</em> and #16 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>Questions #6 and #17 refer to each other.  When one considers that the answer to #17 cannot be D because of question #2, the only correct set of answers; #6 is <em>D</em>, and #17 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>The instructions state that the solution to the quiz is unique.  I am not afraid to use shortcuts, so let's do some analysis on #12.  Uniqueness would imply that neither C,D, nor E could be the answer, as that would necessitate A or B also being a possible answer.  Thus, not only can we eliminate C,D, and E as choices, we also establish that the number of consonants cannot be in the following:
<ul>
<li>1, 4, 9, 16 (perfect squares)</li>
<li>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 (primes)</li>
<li>10, 15, 20 (divisible by 5)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This means that the number of consonant answers can be either 6, 8, 12, 14, or 18.  These are all even numbers, so the answer to #12 is <em>A</em>.  
</p>

<p>#15 directly references this answer, so #15 is also <em>A</em>.  #15 is now established as the only odd-numbered question with the answer of A, which means the answer to #13 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<h3>Let Me See...</h3>

<p>#1 cannot possibly be A or B and remain internally consistent.  There are already two questions answered E so #1 cannot be C.  The answer to #5 is E, eliminating E as a possibility.  The answer to #1, therefore, is <em>D</em>.  This means the answer to number 4 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<p>#4 states that there are 5 A's, and we already have two E's.  This means that the only possible answer to #8 is <em>E</em>.  There are eight vowels and twelve consonants.  The answer to #3 is <em>D</em>, as 8 vowels - 5 A's = 3 E's.  We have eight vowels and twelve consonants.</p>

<h3>My Head Is Starting To Hurt A Little:</h3>

<p>#9 is not A because of the answer to #13 indicates that #15 is the only odd-numbered question with the answer A.  It cannot be C because the answer to #12 is not C.  It cannot be E because we already have 3 E's per #3.  Suppose the answer to #9 was B.  The answer to #11 would then necessarily be B-- but that would be a contridiction, since the answers to #4 and #9 would be B.  Hence the answer to #9 is <em>D</em>.</p>

<p>The answer to #11 cannot be A since #4 is B.  Hence the answer to #2 must be A as the other answers have been established.  This means the answer to #7 is <em>D</em>.  We can now count to see that the answer to #11 is <em>B</em>.</p>

<h3>Almost There:</h3>

<p>
Let's do a little letter counting.

A: 4
B: 3
C: 0
D: 7
E: 3
</p>

<p>
#18 cannot possibly be B, C, or D because of the letter counts and number of questions left.  It cannot be E because of #3.  #18 must be <em>A</em>, satisfying the A requirement of 5.
</p>
<p>
#14 and #19 must therefore both be <em>B</em> to make 5 answers B.  We see that the count for letter D in question #14 is correct.
</p>
<p>
Give yourself a pat on the back for asking the indomitable #19!  Note also that the answer spells DAD BEDDED A BAD BAD BABE, which the author recognizes as a Fatal Attraction reference.  What a great test!
