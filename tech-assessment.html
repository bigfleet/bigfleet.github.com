title: Tech Assessment
---

<p>This is designed to be an assessment of your skill and knowledge, giving you a chance to showcase yourself.  You need not attempt every question-- answer those you feel most confident in.  Judgement is based on the quantity and quality of your responses, not necessarily which questions you select.</p>

<p>You are free to use the Internet as a reference during this assessment.  The Internet will be a part of your work environment; it should be a part of your assessment environment.  Consider, though, that neither answers that are not in your own words nor code that is not your own showcase your knowledge or skill.</p>

<h2>Questions:</h2>

  <h3>Programming Languages:</h3>

  <ul>
	  <li>
		For this question, do not assume your audience has technical knowledge.
		What does being a "dynamic" language mean?  What are the alternatives?  What advantages does a dynamic language have over those alternatives?  What are the disadvantages? 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>		
		<li>What is the best example of idiomatic Ruby that you know of?  You need not be the author.  Alternatively, describe the elements of idiomatic Ruby.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>		
		<li>Compare and contrast the underpinnings of object orientation for any/all of these languages: Java, Ruby, and JavaScript.  You are free to substitute any language with which you are more familiar for any other in this comparison.</li>
	</ul>

  <h3>Web Architectures:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>What are the important elements of a RESTful web interface?  What tools and techniques does Rails put in developers' hands to compose such interfaces?</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
	<li>Name all the levels and types of caching that you can think of which are relevant to the request/response cycle of a web application.  For extra credit, rank them in order of implementation difficulty and explain your rankings.</li>
	</ul>	
	<ul>
	<li>Nick Kallen, an architect at Twitter, has said "having one 100% Beef Database doesn't scale".  Explain why you agree or disagree.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
			<li>What makes PostgreSQL a compelling choice over MySQL?  Does PostgreSQL have any weaknesses compared to MySQL?  For extra credit, answer these questions for a non-technical audience.</li>

	<p>Amazing Mazes (#31)</p>


	<p>by Matt Linnell</p>


	<p>We&#8217;ve had crosswords, cryptograms, chess puzzles, madlibs &#8230; so why don&#8217;t we try our hand at mazes? We can define the two basic components of this problem as:</p>


	<ul>
	<li>Generating the maze</li>
		<li>Solving the maze</li>
	</ul>


	<h3>Generating the maze</h3>


	<p>The maze is to be rectangular in shape, with the height and width determined at run time. All nodes of the maze must be reachable from any point. In other words, if one were to randomly pick a start/stop, the maze is always solvable. Furthermore, let us enforce that only 1 viable solution for the maze exists for any given start/stop (you cannot reach the same destination from 2 different routes). Generate an <span class="caps">ASCII</span> output representing the maze.</p>


	<h3>Solving the Maze</h3>


	<p>Given a maze produced from your above code, find the solution. Produce <span class="caps">ASCII</span> output to demonstrate/visualize solution.</p>
	
	<p>If you are unable to actually implement a solution, describe the approach and algorithms that you would have used.</p>
