Note:  The applause was cut in volume due to the exessively loud noises otherwise,
there is no other alterations.  Levels in the first tune may have fluttered a bit and two 
"pops" heard are the gains on the apogee being raised and me turning off the soft-limit.
Thanks to those that made this possible...
