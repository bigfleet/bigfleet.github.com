This recording was made from an FM stereo broadcast by BBC Radio 1 and remastered by our resident expert, Mr. Barnes using Steinberg software.  This was the last night of the 10 month Invisible Touch tour and in the audience that night were the Prince and Princess Of Wales.  Listening to Phil's introduction to That's All, "this is a song about living with someone who's a pain in the arse", I wonder whether there was any chord struck with the Royal guests?
When we heard the clarity and detail in this recording, we were blown away.  A careful balance between noise reduction and preserving dynamics has been achieved.  Sonically, the listener is placed somewhere near the centre circle at Wembley Stadium!   --i4detail July 2002
