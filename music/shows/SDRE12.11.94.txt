"We don't go there because one person in the band, for his own private reasons, simply refuses.
So we're going without him. The idea is that because the show is acoustic, perhaps we can get away with only having one guitar.
 We're coming up with a set that will hopefully not suffer much for Dan's absence." -Nate
