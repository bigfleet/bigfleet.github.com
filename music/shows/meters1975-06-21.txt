Notes:
This is some raw shit here.  Not the best recording, most likely from cassette masters. 
The vocals distort and clip somewhat throughout. There is some static on d1t08-d1t10.  d1t09 cuts, probably a cassette flip.
A very fun glimpse into the early history of the band that Keith Richards calls the "Greatest Band on the Planet"
