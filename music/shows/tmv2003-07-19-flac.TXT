Notes:
 - The set is incomplete. I lost track of time & didn't swap discs. The
   disc cuts out right during the "Take The Veil" bass solo.
 - I showed up late and did not have choice positioning. I was staring almost directly
   a concrete pillar.
 - It's my first recording, so gimme a break.
 - This will fit on a single 80 minute CDR when recorded DAO.
 - I normally don't bother with MP3, but encoded an MP3 version for download at
