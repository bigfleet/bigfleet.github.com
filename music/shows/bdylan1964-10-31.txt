This is a speed corrected version of the "All Hallows' Eve & More"
double CD, which was a sonic upgrade of "Halloween Mask".  This is
the first full length soundboard recording of a Dylan concert, and
he is in excellent form.  It includes what I think is a definative
version of "Talking John Birch Paranoid Blues".  And the hillarious
classic Dylan moment in "I Don't Believe You" is priceless.

This posting includes a bonus Joan Baez track from this show that
is not available on either of the above CDs.

Broadside Radio Broadcast (WBAI-FM, New York, NY); May 1962


DEEP: The quintessential Dylan concert up to that point in time, as important to 1964 as the
Manchester broadcast is to 1965 or Guitars Kissing to 1966. The sound is much smoother, fuller
and has more "punch" than previous CDs I've heard of this show. This one is pristine, with
Dylan's voice more natural and the guitar/harmonica eliciting a much richer tone. Dylan at his
early best - humorous, charming and witty in-between songs and strong, confident and defiant
during them. As a bonus, you get the WBAI-FM "Broadside" radio show from '62 in superb
quality. The double-jewel packaging is superb, with a classy black and gold color scheme and
vintage Bob and Joan photos. Essential listening for everyone.

CDG: A classic performance in excellent quality, in part due to some digital filtering to remove
tape hiss.
