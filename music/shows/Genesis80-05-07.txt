Duke's Travels you will notice is much louder than the rest of the show.  This is because I took it not from the bootleg, but from the Genesis Archive #2 boxset, which is the recording direct from the master reels.  The only reason I did this is for the clarity of an absolutely wonderful & rare performance of this instrumental.
