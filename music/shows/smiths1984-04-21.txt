VINYL PARTY, DE MEERVAART, AMSTERDAM 21/4/84 
This Charming Man 
Still Ill 
Miserable Lie 
What Difference Does It Make? 

This came with the Italian book THE SMITHS published by Stampa Alternativa. 
Although this looks official, it is not and should be considered a bootleg. 

The tracks are all available on the more interesting and easier to 
find bootleg "The Butterfly Collector".
