David Hollister's comments: Set 3 has unknown # of PCM gens.  Disc 3 is an 
80 minute disc, but it can fit on a 74 if you want to leave off the post-show
chatter. I cleaned up pops during Dark Star with SF pencil tool.  There are 
still a couple of very small spots of what sounds like static during Dark Star,
usually only in one channel.  I didn't feel they were worth bothering with.
Small clicks at 25:34, 26:35 in Dark Star. Lots of small zits and stuff 
all over the place, presumably from the PCM tape.
