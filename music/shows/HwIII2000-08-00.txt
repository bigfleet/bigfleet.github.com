this is an Official Hank III release
due to the world's shittiest recording contract
this was released to hopefully get Curb Records to toss him off the label

again Hank Williams III does not support his own record label 
and would rather see you share these live shows 
if he cant make money of them nobody else should either..
please DO NOT MAKE MP3s of these recordings
i will leave them up on furthurnet.com for many many to enjoy
