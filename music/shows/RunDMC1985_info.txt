Run DMC
1985
The Apollo Theater
New York City, NY

I received this CD in a trade and am not sure excatly what the source of
this recording is although clearly it comes originally from an FM broadcast.
There are a few flaws (odd cuts) on this CD and a few moments where the DJ 
talks over the music.  Nevertheless, if you like Run DMC, this is a special CD
and the music sounds great!  When I received this CD, it had test beeps placed 
over most of the swearing on this CD.  I removed them by applying a very tight
notch filter over just the parts with the test tone.
