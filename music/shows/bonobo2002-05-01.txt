I split the tracks according to the mood of the mix. When the beats dropped or the bpm slowed down i split the track. When the tempo changed and when the melodies changed i also split the tracks. This was more of a dance orientated set as opposed to his laid back trip-hop albums. If you have any questions, comments or complaints get a hold of me on DC++, or email me on my etree website.
