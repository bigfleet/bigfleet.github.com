The Pub hadn't figured on the heat being a big problem this night.  It was almost unbearable.  It definitely affected the performance and the audience.  The levels on the recording were running hot, but the taper suspects that there were some equipment problems that helped add some of the distortion heard throughout the recording.  At one moment during the show, this problem gets out of hand and Doug apologizes for hurting anyone's ears.
