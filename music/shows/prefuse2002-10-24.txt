i have both studio albums (Vocal Studies & Uprock Narratives, One Word Extinguisher) and i still can't seem to be able to name all the tracks. I saw him live 05-31-03 and he played most of those songs. If anyone has the correct names for the songs please let me know. Email me on etree or pm me on DC++. Sorry for the inconvenience, labatte.
