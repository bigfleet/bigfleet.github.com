Notes:
 -This is the equalized version.
 -There is a drop during "Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)" at 07:14. I tried to
	remove it but there is still a hint of it there.
 -I cut the talking and cheering before the encore, "Concertina," so the 
	whole performance can fit on an 80-minute CD-R. In case you are 
	wondering what Cedric said:
	"Thank you for coming out."
	"Thank you to Alvin for spinning up here, who made it
		look like 'Showtime at the Apollo.'"
	"And once again thank you to Saul Williams, who quite
		frankly kicked your fucking ass."
