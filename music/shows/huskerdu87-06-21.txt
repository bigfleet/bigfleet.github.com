Notes:                  From soundboard tape.  The liner notes state, "No
                        one knows where [the performance] was recorded, and
                        perhaps this is fitting."  Fitting or not, and
                        notwithstanding a story about this being stolen from
                        the soundboard at an Albany NY show, direct A-B
                        comparison to an audience tape of the Town & Country
                        show confirms the date and venue listed above.  "Hare
                        Krsna" (which, it's almost frightening to note, is
                        actually spelled correctly in the track listing) is
                        a throw-in from the Warner Bros Do You Remember
                        promo CD.  The sound is occasionally muddy and the
                        midrange is a little weak, but overall this is a
                        good-sounding CD.  KTS did a nice job on the
                        silk-screening of the disk artwork, which is a photo
                        of Bob standing with the flying vee.
