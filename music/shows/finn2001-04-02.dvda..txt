I got a DVDRom for Christmas, plus the DVD of Neil Finn's 7 World's 
Collide, and decided to do a digital rip on the computer so I could have 
the full set instead of the hobbled version that was released on CD.  I 
figured someone might be interested, but being an official release 
wasn't sure if this was the place to post it.  I've seen other rips of 
DVDs/videos here, so unless someone objects, I'll post it over the 
weekend.

Note: I removed Lisa Germano's songs as they simply ruined the flow of 
the show - they just don't sound like they belong.  I ripped this purely 
for me , so if these two omissions bother you, don't bother to download 
it.  Personally, the set is much stronger without her songs, and in fact 
it appears that Paper Doll may be from a different night than the two 
songs surrounding it and was dropped right in between them.  Hole In The 
Ice and The Climber naturally flow together.  The transition is 
seamless.  

I think any Finn/Crowded House fan will enjoy it.  Please post more 
Finn/CH stuff if you've got it!
