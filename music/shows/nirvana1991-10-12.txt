Nirvana Bootography Review:
When this disc was released it created a huge buzz amoung Nirvana fans. The buzz was not only
for the incredible show, but also for the never before heard demos! Tracks 18 - 23 were previously
unsurfaced ( they are mislabeled as "Fecal Matter Demos"). The bonus tracks included "Bambi Slaughter,"
"Clean Up Before She Comes," "Black & White Blues," the "About a Girl" and "Drain You" demos, and then
the complete "Beans" which included the intro that was missing from "Outcesticide III" (better sound
quality also). These tracks were later released as part of "Outcesticide IV - Rape Of The Vaults" (same source). 

10-12-91 is one of the best Nirvana shows ever recorded and can be found on at least three seperate discs.
The vocals are blistering and extremely solid. The drums are a little loud and drown out the bass somewhat,
but the performace is raw and full of energy. An early "Rape Me" & "Lounge Act" would have been nice additions
to the setlist, but there can't be any complaints about the songs that were performed. A few times during the show,
stage divers knock over the mic stand and the vocals are lost for a few seconds (Krist tells them to watch it.)
It's a fun show to listen to and a favorite among Nirvana bootleg collectors. 

This is a MUST HAVE for any Nirvana fan!
