How could I introduce the new tree better than in the words of Jim and Braden, the masterminds behind the project?

Here are the main details:

Jim's introduction:
... our good friend Braden Strickler has done it again. He's recently compiled and lovingly mastered, almost exclusively from soundboard recordings,
an 8-DISC SET which runs chronologically from August 1967 to January 2001. It's like an expanded version of the "Rock 'n' Roll Cowboy" concept,
but with far superior sound.

Thank, of course, to Braden, for agreeing to let me tree this one. Braden makes incredible compilations, often - for his own enjoyment and that of
his friends. Many of them are non-Neil-related, and I helped convince him that this one deserves wide distribution on Rust.

Here's Braden's "introduction" to "Neil Young: A Perfect Echo," which includes the track list for the 8-disc set:

NEIL YOUNG: A PERFECT ECHO

This is a compilation of soundboard recordings from 1967-2001. The term soundboard is a bit of a misnomer. By soundboard I mean, basically, not an audience recording. Some are true soundboards, while others are FM, TV, ALD, or video-sourced recordings. The recordings were all taken from cdrs or videos that are circulating in the trading community.

Each track was checked out in Cool Edit with headphones, and may have had some cleanup done to remove any odd clicks, hiss, or other sound quality problems. The volume was set on each track so as to have them at similar volumes. Fades were added at the beginnings and ends of each track, so the tracks don't segue, for the most part. There are a couple of segues where successive songs were taken from the same concert, so it still needs to be burned DAO. Most of the banter between tracks was removed to make room for more tracks.

There are a total of 115 tracks (109 songs, as 6 get repeated). Some years were heavy with available recordings (1976 and 1989 come to mind). I tried to balance the set by not using too many songs from a single show. The entire 8 discs run in, roughly, chronological order.

Originally, I started making this as just a personal compilation from my collection. It took about a month to put together, including the planning of what would be included, the remastering of the tracks, and, finally, the creation of the artwork. At first, I didn't have a title and was just going to call it "a soundboard archive." While fixing some soft static in Natural Beauty, the title came to me, when he sang "I heard a perfect echo die...". I was going to call it "Perfect Echo Die", but Jim Leonard, our friendly AOTW coordinator, persuaded me to leave off the word "die," so now we have the title "A Perfect Echo".

The intent was to make a nice sampling of soundboard recordings from throughout his career. Its sort of like an expanded "Rock 'n' Roll Cowboy," with the intent to keep the sound quality higher and more consistent.
