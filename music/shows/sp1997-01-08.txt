The Smashing Pumpkins
January 8th, 1997
Vancouver, BC.  GM Place

FM>DAT>CDR?

I'm sorry, but I have no idea what generation CDR this comes from, even after
trying to find the bootlist of the person from whom I obtained the show.

It's a great show.  Possibly one of the best of the era.  Enjoy.
