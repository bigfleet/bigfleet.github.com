Comment: Release party for "Neon golden". Performed with String & Brass section. 
Notwist performed upstairs & Console performed downstairs - at the same time.
Console's samples were broadcast simultanously on FM radio. Attendees were 
asked to bring hand-held radios & to tune in the Console performance while watching
Notwist.
