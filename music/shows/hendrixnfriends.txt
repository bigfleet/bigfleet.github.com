This music was liberated from a bootleged Hendrix concert in a London coffeehouse. 
Apparently a whole bunch of stars of the era stood in during this set, including:
Jim Morrison, Johnny Winter and Buddy Miles. The exact date of the event is 
unknown(by me), but it features some incredible and hilarious music.


Track 4 ,"Morrison's Lament,"  features a hideously dosed Morrison throwing an 
acid tantrum with gentle Jimmy trying to calm him down and keep his groove.  
Despite of (or because of) the heavy medication sizzling on these tracks this 
is some really great music...

Here are the tracks as they are described on the CD:

Hendrix_01 - Red House>			      [10:56]
	       Wake Up This Morning
Hendrix_02 - And You Find Yourself Dead	[8:01]
Hendrix_03 - Bleeding Heart			[12:25]
Hendrix_04 - Morrison's Lament		[5.14]
Hendrix_05 - Tomorrow Never Knows		[3:28]
Hendrix_06 - Uranus Rock			[3:06]
Hendrix_07 - Outside Woman Blues		[8:04]
Hendrix_08 - Sunshine of Your Love		[2:15]		

Total Length: 53:42
