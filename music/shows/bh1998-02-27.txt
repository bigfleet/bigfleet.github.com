notes(from benharper.net):
Ben made a solo appearance for 99X's "Live X" before a gig later that night. About 1:50 into "Roses From My Friends", Ben stopped the song and said "I've got to start this over. I'm sorry. Sorry about that you guys with the tape." After the complete song, Ben strummed riffs of what would become "The Woman in You." Before "Widow of a Living Man" he said, "I might mess this one up too, but I might not. I haven't played it for a long long time, but I'm going to go for it." The audience chuckled.

enjoy!
