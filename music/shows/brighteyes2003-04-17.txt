I accidentally used a minidisc that already had a show at the beginning, so i ran out of time way sooner than i thought i would.  as a result, it shut off in the middle of trees get wheeled away.  i didn't notice until solid jackson was almost over.  i have no idea how many songs i missed in the middle.  maybe 4 or 5?  anyways, i've been kicking myself for months, but at least you get to hear britt daniel do southern state with them!
