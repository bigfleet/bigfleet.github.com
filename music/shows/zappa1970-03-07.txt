This is how I received the show, no remastering, no digital wonderment. Not a perfect recording, but an historic and rare one. Historic because it's one of Frank's greatest line-ups and rare because there are only two known recordings and this is the better one. I hope you enjoy it. If you like the artwork I created then great, if not make your own. It's fun. It was my first attempt and the impetus for releasing this show to the world at large. The main graphic is a color-altered version of the Mexican release of Hot Rats. Which is also where the title came from. It was all done with whatever software came with my computer. So anyone can do this. For the MAC users, I'm not sure if you can print the Word documents so I've included the individual bitmaps used to make up the documents. All must be sized correctly but it's better than nothing. Everyone else should be able to just print the documents and have a pretty decent cover. It's hard to size them perfectly so you may have to trim a little. I printed mine on Neato jewel case labels which is how they were designed. Since the text I used is fairly generic and embedded in the graphics, I haven't included any special fonts. Basically, you're printing a graphic so you shouldn't need the fonts. If you've got any comments, I'd love to hear them.
