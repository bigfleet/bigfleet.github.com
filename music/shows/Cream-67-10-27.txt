Cream - Live at Grande Ballroom - 10/27/67
Two CDRs 
I bought this over the net from a guy in Australia who 
specializes in Cream.  He remasters boots and sells 
them.  I forgot the Web address and i guess i shouldn't 
give publicity to a profiteer, but he sure does a good 
job.

The front cover is folded at the bottom and put in sideways.  
The insert is interesting.
