Interpol
September 23, 2003
The Ogden Theater 
Denver, CO

Stealth Audio Mid Grade mics -> Sony NZ707 MD -> Compaq SoundMax soundcard -> Goldwave (record + split to wavs) -> shn (mkwact)
Recording Type - General Admission
Body Placement - about 25 feet back, just to the right of the soundboard
Mic Placement - Stereo lapel clips
Sound Quality - Not perfect, but you can hear everything- the mics had a bit of a problem with all the bass- kind of distorted when it was loud
(unfortunately there is no recording settings I could change with my md recorder, so it was basically the best I could get with the equipment I have- a good example of getting what you pay for with a 40 dollar mic)
