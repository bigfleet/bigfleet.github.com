notes:

Pre-FM feed from WLIR-FM recording truck
All stage mics wired to air mix soundboard in recording truck to 
Maxell XLII cassette (no dolby) on a (then brand spankin' new) 
Nakamichi 550 cassette machine.

To computer (23 years later)
via:
cr7a Nakamichi cassette (with azmuth adjust) to SBM1 Sony Super 
Bit Mapper A>D converter to digi in on Linx-one studio card (spdif). 
Recorded in Soundforge and mastered with  CD architect to CD to SHN.

Note...My cassettes have held up over the years better than the 
master reels of these shows.
The master 1/4" reels (recorded on Ampex 456 grand master tape) 
would need to be literally "baked" in order to squeeze out one 
final play as the oxide flakes off the tape!
