Notes:

I received this show marked as 10/10/98 in a trade.  It's clear from the recording that this is actually two shows.

Thanks to http://users.bart.nl/~ljmeijer/oldham/live98.htm we see that it might be 10/8/1998.  He also refers to being in San Jose the day before, and that he performs at Amoeba Records later that day. For the filler, the last track gives the most clues, with the station ID, and the reference to being in Portland the next day.

Many thanks to http://www.palace.free.fr/tab/ without which I could not have recreated the setlist.
