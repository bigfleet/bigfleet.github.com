My fellow trader HV asked me to remaster this show. As far as I know there aren't that many Talk Talk recordings circulating, so I thought it would be nice to release it, despite the average sound quality.     
     
Remastered from an unknown generation copy of the original analog audience recording using Sonic Foundry Sound Forge 6.0, Steinberg FreeFilter 1.1 and various other plugins. Enjoy !

Remaster, SHN and artwork by DocProg (July 20-21 2003)

Do NOT encode to MP3 or any other lossy compression format !
