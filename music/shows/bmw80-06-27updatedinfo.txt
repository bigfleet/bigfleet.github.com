Notes from the seed:
Often mislabeled as 6.12.80 as well as 6.26.80

This show comes from Japanese bootleg: Boot -> EAC [high,secure] -> SHN

It is different from most circulating copies since it includes the
I-Three's opener and also has very high quality sound. The only known
cut in this show is about 5 minutes of crowd clapping before encore.
This is one of my favorite shows.  Get it if you don't have it.
