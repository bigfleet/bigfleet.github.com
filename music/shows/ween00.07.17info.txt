==========================
7/17  the Chili Pepper: Ft. Lauderdale FL-aaron got too drunk to.....walk...but 
somehow managed to channel it all into something gloriously horrible for our 
"concert". i'd apologize for the 50 minute "poopship destroyer" but somehow i  think
 you deserve it for living in ft. lauderdale.
