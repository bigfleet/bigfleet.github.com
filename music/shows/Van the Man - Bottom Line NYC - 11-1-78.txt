-------------
I think this is a great show.
I'll post during the week as fast as I can.
If you need parts tell me ASAP so you don't lose the whole track
If you need full reposts email me at the end of the completed post.
I use a newsreader for groups so if you post to the group I may not see it.
I am posting two covers choices - that's much better than No covers.

I'd like some Tim Buckely or live New Zealand rock - Chris Knox, David Kilgour, Clean etc.
Post 'em if you got 'em.
thanx
