Notes on Binaural Recording Enjoyment:

These tapes were recorded using semi-binaural microphone placement.
This means that, while the sound on speakers is good, dramatically 
realistic playback can be had using headphones, especially good ones 
(the taper prefers the use of Sennheiser HD600's).

Recordings made and played back this way put you right in my creaking seat, 
listening to the natural sound of Bjork’s tinkling red dress, and that girl 
asking in my ear if she can borrow my binoculars or that guy 10 seats over coughing...

If you listen to this recording using headphones on a computer, 
be sure that the "speaker" and "environmental" settings of your audio driver are NOT 
set to "headphones" or "spatial" (or equivalent). That is, the sound card should 
be set to play through speakers with no environmental processing 
(else the binaural effect is ruined).
