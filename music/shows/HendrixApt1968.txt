at Jimi's New York apartment sometime in late 1968.

This is a great rare find.  You can hear Hendrix flipping the music pages as he practices.  Unfortunately not 
much is known of this recording.  If you have any more information please email me.  This is a rare 
recording of great quality, so please treat it as so and DON'T ENCODE IT TO MP3.

Enjoy and keep speading the tunes,

In an email forwarded to the etree@etree.org mailing list, "Experience Hendrix, L.L.C"
said that this concert was "authorized by the previous administration of the hendrix estate"
and that it has been out of print for more than five years, and that no royalties are 
received from the sale of this show (it originally came with a book about hendrix as a bonus).

So this should be O.K. to trade
