This recording is special for a number of reasons. It's the earliest
(decent) surviving recording of a live show by the band. Taped
a few weeks before their debut album (Unknown Pleasures) was
recorded, the band is caught still playing three tracks from their
first release, 'An Ideal For Living'. Also of note is the siren introduction
to 'Disorder', a performance of 'Ice Age' and an early take on 'I Remember
Nothing'. Amidst some serious heckling, the band deliver a kick ass high
energy show... Enjoy!
