Note: * There was a horrible noise at the beginning that I used filters to reduce the loud buzzing noise. ** Last track fades out and is cut short. This is how I received this recording in trading. If you know of a complete recording or better source email amberphil@cox.net

This recording has minor flaws but sounds great. Do not trade on etree. Hippies get pissy.
