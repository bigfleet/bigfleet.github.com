Info pieced together by Keith Soltys <ksoltys@home.com>:

  Television broadcast by RTBF:

     Naima (7:08)
     Blue Valse (11:45)
     drum solo (3:15)
     My Favorite Things (17:40)
     bass solo (10:05)
     Impressions (11:05)

The disc:

Track 1 - Naima, Blue Valse, drum solo
Track 2 - My Favourite Things
Track 3 - Impressions (10 minute bass solo from the beginning is cut out)
Track 4 - Afro Blue

Afro Blue is not from that concert, as far as I can tell from the setlists
on the web. It may be from another show entirely. He did perform on the
26th, but did all of A Love Supreme.
