i dug this old analog cassette tape out of a drawer the other day.
it used to be my favorite mixed hip-hop tape... it's origins are very sketchy. i got a copy from a good 
friend in Montreal, and he does not know the origins either, the only marking on the tape was a label 
which read Apollo 93.  i have no clue what this is in reference to; obviously if someone knows please 
email and tell me.

it's  a great mix, and i hate to see it fade into oblivion on a discarded cassette tape.


IMPORTANT NOTE:  this disc is MIXED, not mixed in the sense that some kid at home made a mixed tape 
of his favorite songs, but mixed by a hip hop dj.... so if you don't burn it DAO you will be sorry...
