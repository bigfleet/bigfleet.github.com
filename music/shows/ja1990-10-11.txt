Commentary:

The photo in the center of this disc's cover was taken from Rolling Stone Magazine, and 
is the same picture used for the cover of Perry Farrell's Rev< album.

This show is pretty common, it is the professionally recorded 1990 show from Milan Italy 
which had both professional audio and video taping for MTV Italy.  Therefore the 
recording quality on this disc is quite high.

The video of this show that shows just how amusing the performance is.  There is some 
interesting chatter with the crowd, and at one point, Perry accidentally starts singing 
into the microphone stand, instead of the microphone itself.

Track Origins:
Recorded:10/11/1990 City Square, Milan, Italy
