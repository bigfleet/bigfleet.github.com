This has to be one of the best Tortoise shows I have ever heard. It is from the tour supporting "Millions Now Living Will Never Die" and even has an early version of "The Equator" from "TNT." This version is even better, IMHO. Back when I got this show, I was trading with DAT-Heads who didn't have CD burners, so my copy is XLII from the DAT. I hope that someone will SHN this show if they have the DAT! But, here is my version. Originally, I made a 1 CD 74 Minute version of this. This show originally clocked in around 81 Minutes, so I edited the WAV's so that it would fit on an 80. I took the liberty of shortening up the "looped" recording after "Cornpone Brunch" (the yelling voice backwards and forwards) as well as starting a fade early on "Grazing In The Grass" while Tortoise was breaking it down at the end. In my opinion it does not detract from the show.
