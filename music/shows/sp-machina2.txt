blair's notes
`````````````
  I had to fix some dead air gaps cause it was annoying the heck out
  of me, i did NOT take anything of value out.  I used a Plextor
  UltraPlex 40max to extract the audio with EAC v0.9pb6 and did shn
  conversion with mkwACT v0.97b1 with seek abilities (i love this
  shn v3)

some extra stuff i found on this

  Machina II / The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music by The Smashing
  Pumpkins is a followup to Machina, and the last album from the band. 
  As a final farewell, and a fuck you to a record label that didn't give 
  them the support they deserved, a limited pressing album was made 
  (3x10" + 2LP, 5 discs total) and given away to be bootlegged out among 
  the fans. All tracks are completely new/unheard, except for Real Love, 
  which appears to be the same as the one found on the "Friends & Enemies" 
  60m cassette>bootleg, and Le Deux Machina, which is the same synth version 
  as found on the acoustic machina demos. Just to clear up any possible 
  confusion, this is the final album from the band. There are only 25 
  copies. There will NOT be a CD pressing. 
  
  Numerous scans are included with this release.
  The 25 copies are on hand-cut, hand-numbered, non-lacquered acetate.
  The 3 10"s come in plain white sleeves, the 2LP comes in a plain black 
  sleeve with paper pasted to the inside, including "ch5/the story of june 
  (so far)". The discs are labeled with small stickers bearing CR 01 thru 
  CR 04 (CR 04 is the 2LP, w/ sides A-D).

The story of MACHINA II/the friends and enemies of modern music:

On September 5, 2000, 25 packages were sent out via FedEx containing 1 
each of the 3 EPs and the double LP along with the story. There was no 
record cover, no track listing, no credits, and no other information of 
any type.

The songs were divided into four records; three 10" vinyl acetates and a 
double 12" acetate. Issued on Constantinople Records (Billy's own label) 
the records were given catalog numbers of CR-01, CR-02, CR-03 (the 10" 
EPs), and CR-04 (the double 12" LP). Twenty-five copies of each record 
were pressed, and stickers identifying each by their catalog number were 
afixed to each side of each record. The EPs were issued in plain white 
sleeves, the LPs in plain black. The sleeves were then completely wrapped 
in clear tape with various designs printed on it. Each of the records 
featured a different design.
