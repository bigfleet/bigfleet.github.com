Notes (Fresko):
Incredible performance that takes off like a shotgun to the head and
never gives the audience a chance to recover. Perfect Rocket > Bury Me, fantastic Siva. 


Flaws:
*	Because this rip comes from 2 discs, split before track 12, 
it is possible that the transition there will not be seamless. 
*	There is a tiny instant of diginoise in track 12, at 3:55. 
This is also present on the DDC-4 DAT tape.
