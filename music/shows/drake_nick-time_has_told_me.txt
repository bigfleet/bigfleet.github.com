Nick Drake - Time Has Told Me
I received this in trade. It was digitized from vinyl and then futzed with further. It covers the TIA material, possibly from different copies of those tapes, plus it has some studio outtakes I haven't seen elsewhere. These two blurbs and the track list were found on the web:
"Time Has Told Me" is an incredible 3LP vinyl only set featuring a total of 44 unreleased tracks. All songs are transferred from original copies of Drake's home tapes, expertly EQ'd and mastered using noise reduction and speed correction. It has stuff not on other boots. Apparently Scott has had a change of heart and decided to release some stuff he got from the Drake - at least that's what it sounds like is on here. 43 tracks on my copy.
