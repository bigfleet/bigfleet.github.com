Additional Comments on show:
From Blue Fish
A great soundboard recording.  Polar Bear Records claims that this is a Warner Brothers official recording that was initially going to be released as a live album but was instead replaced by another studio album.  The quality is fantastic and James puts on a very good performance.  There are a few fades between songs but that is all there really is to complain about.  I'm not sure how much this show has been circulated but it will make a great addition to any James Taylor collection.  Overall, a definite must have!!  Any additional info on date and venue would be greatly appreciated.
